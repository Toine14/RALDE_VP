Bacteria and other contaminants might remain here and subsequently contaminate the inside of the vessel once it is opened. Just like the CO2 incubator, a water bath requires a regular disinfection routine. You must ensure that the water bath is emptied completely and disinfected prior to the addition of fresh water.

Before starting your work you should empty the entire work area and disinfect it. Do not simply spray your disinfection solution on everything, but instead wipe the solution across the entire surface of the cabinet. Then apply the same procedure to every item that you will place into the cabinet. A working direction from 'clean' to 'dirty' should be established at this time: if you are right-handed, you might start at the left side with placing your dishes, flasks or plates and all clean, new materials such as pipette tips. In the center is your working area where you will open your consumables and change the media. The right end of the cabinet will be your designated waste area with a container for used tips, etc."
